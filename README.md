# San-Francisco-Business-Industry-Analysis

### Background
From the base for gold rush to the hub of high-tech, San Francisco has become an important center of finance and technology. It will interesting to see the change/transition of the popular industries in this fast-paced city. Where are the pockets of high concentration of active business? What are the different industry types that have emerged or declined in San Francisco over the years?   

In this project, I used R to generate some data analysis and visualization to take a closer look at the business/industry trend.

### Data

This dataset includes the locations of businesses that pay taxes to the City and County of San Francisco. Each registered business may have multiple locations and each location is a single row. The Treasurer & Tax Collectorâ€™s Office collects this data through business registration applications, account update/closure forms, and taxpayer filings.
